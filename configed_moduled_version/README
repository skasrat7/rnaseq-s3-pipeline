Syntax for Running
Here's the exact syntax:
First Time Setup:

1. Edit configuration files with your specific paths/settings
nano nextflow.config  # Update S3 paths, input CSV, etc.

2. Make script executable
chmod +x run_pipeline.sh

3. Run the workflow
./run_pipeline.sh

Manual Execution (alternative):
# Prepare references (first time only)
nextflow run prep_references.nf

# Run main pipeline  
nextflow run nf-core/rnaseq -c nextflow.config -profile local -resume
